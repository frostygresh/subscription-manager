subscription-manager for Debian
------------------------------

Required packages for build
---------------------------

* build-essential
* devscripts (for dch)
* equivs (for mk-build-deps)


Steps before build
------------------

Copy debian-directory into the source root

    cp -r contrib/debian .

Adapt package-version (new version)..

    dch -v <new-version>

..or just increase release-number

    dch -i


Install dependencies
--------------------

Create and install meta-package that pulls in the required build-dependencies:

    mk-build-deps debian/control
    apt install ./subscription-manager-build-deps-*.deb

The apt is able to install local deb-packages starting with version 1.1


Build package
-------------

Build the binary package (the resulting package files can be found in the parent-directory of the source-root-directory):

    dpkg-buildpackage -b

For additional information about debian package building please refer to the debian developer manuals (https://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals).

Debian packaging manuals can also be installed locally through debian packages (e.g. 'debian-policy')
